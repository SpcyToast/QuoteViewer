#Project Overview
This project was created to grasp the basics of android development using Jetpack Compose. 
It consists of a single fragment that either displays a random quote provided by an API or shows a history of all previously seen quotes from the session.

#Setup and Run instructions
- Clone this repository from github to your local device.
- open the project in android studio.
- sync gradle files by either clicking sync now or by clicking the elephant with a downwards diagonal arrow icon located in the top right.
- Build the app by clicking into Build menu and then Assemble 'app' Run configuration.
- Set up a device emulator by clicking on the tools menu, then Device Manager. Add a new device by clicking the plus symbol and follow on screen instructions.
- Run the app using your desired emulator by either clicking on the run menu and then clicking Run 'app'.
- The app should launch in the emulator ready for use

#Dependancies and Tools
##Jetpack Compose
Jetpack compose is very similar to what react is to web development. Instead of integrating scripts to a XML file you write code that reacts dynamically to the state of the app. For example, you can have a composable function that show apples and another composable function that shows oranges. By changing the state in the app through something like a button, you are able conditionally render either on or the other. Depending on how functions are writted, UI templates can be easily created to render exactly what is wanted without repeating code.
